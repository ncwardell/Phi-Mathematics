# §5.15 New Result: The Depth Derivation Theorem

**This is the central structural result of Part V. It shows that all major particle depths are derivable from three framework numbers, not fitted to masses.**

## The Three Inputs

All three inputs come from the Fibonacci/Lucas/meeting point structure derived in Parts I-II. None are free parameters.

1. **F(5) = 5** — The algebraic completion index. The first Fibonacci number equal to its own index. The discriminant of self-reference is $\sqrt{5}$ = √F(5). This is derived in Part I (Theorem 8).

2. **F(9) = 34** — The last meeting point. The largest integer appearing in more than one metallic Fibonacci sequence. This is derived computationally in Part II (verified to 10¹⁵) and bounds the particle spectrum.

3. **L(4) = 7** — The fourth Lucas number. Appears independently as the denominator of the weak mixing angle: si$n^2$θ_W = $\varphi$/L(4) + $\alpha^2$ (Part III). This is the strand-symmetric Lucas value (L(4) = |L(−4)| = 7).

## The Derivation Chain

**Theorem (Depth Derivation):** *Given only F(5) = 5, F(9) = 34, and L(4) = 7, all particle depths follow:*

**Step 0 — Electron:**
d(e) = 0 (ground state, by definition)

**Step 1 — EM depth:**
d($\alpha$) = 2F(5) = 2 $\times$ 5 = **10**

*Justification:* The EM coupling is the self-referential closure at the algebraic completion depth. The factor 2 arises because electromagnetic interaction requires a round trip — the field must propagate outward and return. This is the double-depth 2F(5) that appears in the $\alpha$ equation: 5π$\alpha^2$ + $\alpha$ = $\varphi$^(−2F(5)).

**Step 2 — Gen 4 lepton:**
d(Gen4) = F(9) = **34**

*Justification:* The last meeting point is the deepest spatial resonance where metallic harmonics constructively interfere. Beyond F(9) = 34, no further meeting points exist — the particle spectrum terminates. This is derived from the meeting point theorem (Part II).

**Step 3 — Tau (Midpoint Theorem):**
d($\tau$) = F(9)/2 = 34/2 = **17**

*Justification:* The tau sits at the midpoint of the particle depth range [0, F(9)]. This is the fold/unfold boundary on the breathing torus: below d = 17, particles are in the unfolding regime ($\sigma$ = −1); above it, in the folding regime ($\sigma$ = +1). The tau itself is the first fold-state lepton, confirming: $\sigma$($\tau$) = +1 (fold). The sign flip at the midpoint is a topological necessity — the breath cycle must reverse on the torus.

*Cross-check:* 17 = F(7) + L(3) = 13 + 4, confirming the Fibonacci-Lucas decomposition. Also d($\tau$) − d(e) = d(Gen4) − d($\tau$) = 17, so tau is equidistant from electron and Gen4.

**Step 4 — Up quark (L(4) Spacing):**
d(u) = d($\alpha$) − L(4) = 10 − 7 = **3**

*Justification:* The spacing L(4) = 7 separates adjacent force/particle scales. We verify: d($\alpha$) − d(u) = d($\tau$) − d($\alpha$) = 7. The EM depth is the arithmetic mean of the strong depth and the tau depth: d($\alpha$) = (d(u) + d($\tau$))/2 = (3 + 17)/2 = 10. This places $\alpha$ equidistant between the strong force crystallization and the third-generation lepton — it mediates between them.

*Cross-check:* d(u) = 3 = F(4), the triangle depth where the strong force crystallizes (SU(3) from 3 witnessing nodes).

**Step 5 — Muon (Force+1 Rule):**
d($\mu$) = d($\alpha$) + 1 = 10 + 1 = **11**

*Justification:* The first massive particle at each force scale sits one depth unit past the force crystallization depth. The muon is the first particle whose mass requires the full EM self-witnessing correction — it lives at the first address past the EM depth.

*Cross-check:* 11 = |L(−5)| (fifth negaLucas). Also 11 = L(5), connecting to the algebraic completion through the Lucas companion.

**Step 6 — W/Z bosons:**
d(W/Z) = F(5)² = 5² = **25**

*Justification:* The electroweak scale is the square of the algebraic completion depth. This makes structural sense: the weak force involves the SU(2) doublet structure, and the doublet introduces a second factor of the algebraic completion. Alternatively: d(W/Z) = d($\mu$) + d($\tau$) − d(u) = 11 + 17 − 3 = 25, from the sum conservation $\mu$ + $\tau$ = u + W = 28.

*Cross-check:* d(W/Z) = 25 = d($\mu$) + 2L(4) = 11 + 14. Also F(5)² = F(10)/L(5) $\times$ L(5) = 55/11 $\times$ 55... no, simply 5² = 25.

**Step 7 — Higgs (Force+1 Rule):**
d(H) = d(W) + 1 = 25 + 1 = **26**

*Justification:* Same pattern as the muon: the first massive scalar at the weak scale sits one depth unit past the weak boson depth. The Higgs is to the W/Z what the muon is to the photon — the first state that requires the force's self-witnessing correction for its mass.

*Cross-check:* d(H) = 26, and the top quark (heaviest fermion) also lives near d $\approx$ 26, confirming the Higgs-top partnership.

**Step 8 — Planck mass:**
d(Pl) = 3F(9) + F(5) = 3 $\times$ 34 + 5 = 102 + 5 = **107**

*Justification:* The Planck depth is three times the last meeting point plus the algebraic completion. The factor 3 = F(4) is the triangle number (SU(3) from witnessing). This formula also yields the gravity exponent: 2d(Pl) − 2F(5) = 2(3F(9) + F(5)) − 2F(5) = 6F(9) = 204, confirming the gravity equation $\alpha$/α_G = $\varphi$^(204 − 1/(4$\pi$)).

*Cross-check:* 204 = 6F(9) = 6 $\times$ 34 = 12 $\times$ 17 = 12 $\times$ d($\tau$). This resolves the "12 conjecture" from Part III: the factor 12 in the gravity exponent is not the number of directed witnessing edges — it is simply 6F(9)/d($\tau$) = 6F(9)/(F(9)/2) = 12, a consequence of the midpoint theorem.

## The Two Structural Patterns

**Pattern 1 — The Force+1 Rule:**
The first massive particle at each force scale sits one depth unit past the force crystallization depth:
- d($\mu$) = d($\alpha$) + 1 = 11 (first massive state past EM)
- d(H) = d(W) + 1 = 26 (first massive scalar past weak)

This pattern says: once a force crystallizes at depth d, the first particle that requires that force's full self-witnessing correction appears at d+1.

**Pattern 2 — The Midpoint Rule:**
Key particles sit at midpoints of the depth range:
- d($\tau$) = (d(e) + d(Gen4))/2 = 17 (midpoint of full spectrum)
- d($\alpha$) = (d(u) + d($\tau$))/2 = 10 (midpoint between strong and tau)

This pattern says: force scales and generation boundaries are placed symmetrically, as required by the torus topology where the depth circle has a natural halfway point.

## What This Achieves

Before this theorem, particle depths were identified by computing d = log_$\varphi$(m/$m_e$) and rounding to the nearest integer — effectively fitting. Now, eight of the nine major depths (everything except the muon's independent derivation from negaLucas) follow from three framework numbers through arithmetic relationships. The framework predicts *where* particles must sit before knowing their masses.

The remaining question for the muon: the Force+1 derivation (d($\mu$) = d($\alpha$) + 1 = 11) is clean, but the independent derivation through |L(−5)| = 11 requires proving *why* the muon uses the 5th negaLucas index specifically. These two derivations arriving at the same answer (11) from different directions strengthens confidence in both.
